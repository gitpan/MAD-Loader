MAD-Loader

MAD::loader is a module loader and object builder for situations when you
want several modules being loaded dynamically.

For each module loaded this way an builder method may be called with
or without arguments. You may also control where the loader will search for
modules, you may prefix the module names with a custom namespace and you
may change how it will behave on getting errors.
